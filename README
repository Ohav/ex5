crossword.py -

crossword3d.py - 3D matrices, when broken down, are just a set of 2D matrices. Thus, to get the 3D
matrix to a list of 2D ones and reuse the previous code, was our way of tackling the problem.

The main() function calls a new function get_matrices() which according to input, returns all the different 2D
matrices the program will look for the words in. The way this function does this, is by rearranging the
original 3D matrix to a set of 2D matrices which are equivalent to the action requested by the user.

After we get to this point, this is the same problem as crossword.py
